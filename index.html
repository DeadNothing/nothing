    <h2>Nothing.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Stop. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. In our fast-paced world, no one ever slows down to appreciate the smaller things in life. We need now more than ever to unplug, decompress, clear our mind, and live, even if just for a moment, in the nothingness.</p>
    <p>Nothing is what brings true silence, the first step towards inner peace. We are here to help you with that. Through the use of blockchain technology, we have discovered a revolutionary way to deliver nothing in the form of an NFT. We are offering you literally nothing so that you may finally have an escape, and a chance to take a break. When you own one of the Nothing NFTs, you gain absolutely nothing, which is exactly what we plan to sell you.</p> 
    <p>We believe in the value of nothing. Our NFT features an image, featuring nothing except for a canvas filled with a calming off-white color, so that we may effectively deliver nothing to you. We picked this because we believe in minimalism, and the correct route to inner peace is one where life's complexities can go away. We live out this movement for minimalism in everything we do, such as this website, where we avoided the use of any CSS or JavaScript to deliver a calming, minimalist experience.</p>
